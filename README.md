# STOCK MARKET PREDICTION APP
I created a web application that uses Python and Streamlit to predict the stock market. The app likely uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical stock market data and provide predictions for future prices.

Streamlit is a popular web application framework for creating data science applications with interactive visualizations and user interfaces. It allows you to create custom dashboards and web apps that can be easily shared and deployed online.

Overall, this project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning and web development skills, and could be useful for anyone interested in investing in the stock market or analyzing financial data.
